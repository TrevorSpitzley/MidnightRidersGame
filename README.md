You are a futuristic guy killing old people(in
the past, not senior citizens). Upon the killing
of all enemies, the grand-master appears, who 
happens to be your FUTURISTIC self. Sent back
in time to stop YOUR genocide. But little does
your character know, you can't kill your future
self without ending your own life!
